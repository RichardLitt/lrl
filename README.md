lrl
===

For script work concerning low resource languages. This does not include
visualisations, Semantic Web data, or other random scripts that can be
found in my other repositories. 

facebook-scraper
--------

The Facebook scripts in here are for non-automatically harvesting data
from Facebook groups, using manual AJAX querying and saving the source
from the browser. It is not an automatic data collection scheme, nor a
scraper, which makes it legal (afaik). A paper based is currently in
progress. 

maltese-dict
-------

I have developed a GUI and terminal-side dictionary program based on
word lists I have access to; one from the internet, and a cleaned-up
copy available via METASHARE on a CC BY-NC-SA license. I will presumably
keep working on this throughout my time in Malta. 

maltese-*
-------

In development. These are for courses at the University of Malta. One is
a stemmer, based on the NLTK stemmers (Snowball, ISRI). One is a broken
plural noun morphological analyser, based on previous work by Farrugia.
The other is a chunker and basic code switching identifier, based on the
work done in facebook-scraper and on Fabri's theoretical research on Maltese
compounds.
