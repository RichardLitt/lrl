For script work concerning low resource languages. This does not include
visualisations, Semantic Web data, or other random scripts that can be
found in my other repositories. 

Facebook
--------

The Facebook scripts in here are for non-automatically harvesting data
from Facebook groups, using manual AJAX querying and saving the source
from the browser. It is not an automatic data collection scheme, nor a
scraper, which makes it legal (afaik). A paper based is currently in
progress. 

Maltese
-------

I have developed a GUI and terminal-side dictionary program based on
word lists I have access to; one from the internet, and a cleaned-up
copy available via METASHARE on a CC BY-NC-SA license. I will presumably
keep working on this throughout my time in Malta.
